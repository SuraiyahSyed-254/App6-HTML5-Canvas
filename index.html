Brief Description of Goal of Code:
Incorporate a canvas into code and be able to draw on it (via buttons).
 
Known Issues:
Facing issues with incorporating the drawing element in interaction with the canvas. It wasn't working because code wasn't being executed in the right order, so I put script after body.

<script>
//FIXED. I had to put this last so the code will be executed in the right order! Canvas element would go first and then functions would follow to correspond with button work.
var docMod = document.lastModified; // loads last modified time stamp into docMod variable
alert("This file last modified " + docMod); // generates alert box with time stamp. If annoying, comment out this entire line.
console.log("This file last modified " + docMod); // generates message in javaScript console (found in developers tools) with time stamp. 

var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
// This variable is retrieves the connection between function and the canvas element in the body.
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");	
// This variable is the reason that things are being displayed. The 2d string is a must for the context variable so that fillStyle, fillRect, etc. will generate.
	
function drawRectangle(){
 ctx.fillStyle = "black";
 ctx.fillRect(50, 25, 150, 100);
}
//This function generates a rectange with the given dimensions and fills the color with black on the canvas.
	
function drawName(){
 ctx.fillText("Suraiyah", 50, 200);
}
//This writes my name on the canvas.
	
function loadImage(){
 var img = document.getElementById("picture");
  ctx.drawImage(img,5,5);
}
//This loads the image that I included in the body onto the canvas using it's image id.
	
function clearCanvas(){
 c.width = c.width;
}
//This will clear all elements displayed on the canvas by setting canvas width equal to each other.
